0.1.0

* Breaking changes

  * Not parsed as numbers anymore: "10_14" or "10_400" or "-1_2e3_5" or "-$123_456.7" -- very unlikely to see in the wild
  * Not parsed as numbers anymore: '1,2' or '-1,2' or '1,20' or '1,22.0' -- too hard to distinguish from CSV

* Enhancements

  * Using proper versioning scheme - every version of algorithm involves a minor bump!
  * Recover from YAML parsing errors in 1.9

0.0.1.1 / 2014-02-06

* Bug fixes

  * Parse.parse called Parse.ver0 instead of Parse.ver0_0_1. Doh!
